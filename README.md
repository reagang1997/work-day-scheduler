# work-day-scheduler

Created using a table.

For the event column (the middle column), each is given a special attribute "data-hr" to determine if it is in the past/present/future.

If the timeslot is in the past, it is colored a light gray.
If the timeslot is the current hour, it is colored yellow.
If the timeslot is in the future, it is colored green.

The user can click on an event box to type in an event for that hour. 

Once the user clicks the button with the 'add to calender' icon, it is saved into local storage.
